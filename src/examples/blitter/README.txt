# Blitter Examples

This SSD contains a set of example files that are intended to demonstrate the
working of the Blitter "chip".

These examples are in BASIC and coded for clarity rather than the most 
efficient use of the Blitter.

## 1. 1BPPFON

This program demonstrates using the Blitter in one of its simplest use-cases,
where a 1bpp sprite definition (in this case the character ROM) is "exploded" 
to MODE 1 2bpp before being used to "mask" a solid colour on to the screen.
