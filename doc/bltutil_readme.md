# BLTUTIL README

## Introduction

This Document contains an overview of the functions provided on the Blitter and
Paula hardware by the BLTUTIL support ROM. This ROM provides \*commands and 
API entry points to allow access to the enhancements and on the BBC Model B and
Electron provides some Ersatz versions of the extended features of the Master
MOS.

# \*COMMANDS

The following section provides brief overviews of the \*commands provided by 
the ROM. Some commands are only available:
        {B} - Blitter hardware only
        {M} - Ersatz MOS - only on Electron/Model B

## \*ROMS {B}

        *ROMS [V][A][C][I][X|0|1]

Show a list of ROMs

        V - Verbose
        A - All - show all ROMs including those not 
            recognised or ignored by the OS
        C - CRC calculate a CRC for each ROM
        I - Ignore the memory inhibit jumper
        X - Show alternate ROM set
        0 - Show ROM set 0
        1 - Show ROM set 1

ROM sets: there are two ROM sets, usually set 0, including the motherboard ROMs
at 4..7 is accessed by the T65 core. Set 1 is usually made available to the 
hard processor. This can be swapped by the SWROMx jumper.

## \*SRNUKE {B}

The SRNUKE utility. This allows erasing of ROMs or clearing of the entire
Flash ROM in case of crashes at boot time this can be invoked by holding then
"Â£" key at boot.

## \*SRERASE {B}

        *SRERASE <id> [F][I][X|0|1]

        F - force (ignore any errors)
        I - ignore memory inhibit
        X - use alternate ROM set
        0 - use ROM set 0
        1 - use ROM set 1

## \*SRLOAD {B}
        *SRLOAD <filename> <id> [I][X|0|1\]

        F - force (ignore any errors)
        I - ignore memory inhibit
        X - use alternate ROM set
        0 - use ROM set 0
        1 - use ROM set 1

## \*XMDUMP
        *XMDUMP [-8|-16] [#<dev>] <start> <end>|+<len>

        -8      Force 8 columns output
        -16     Force 16 columns output
        #<dev> Specify device number (Blitter=&D1, Paula=&D0)
        <start> Start address in JIM memory
        <end>   End address
        +<len>  Show <len> bytes

Note: `#<dev>`: If no device number is specified Blitter/Paula will be selected
if present.

This dumps "physical" memory i.e. that accessed via JIM, to access that seen by
the 65xx CPU's 64k address space use addresses from bank $FF.


## \*NOICE {B}

        *NOICE [ON|OFF]

Enable NoIce Debugging

## \*NOICEBRK {B}

        *NOICEBRK

Enter noice debugger by executing a sepcial breakpoint instruction. For 6502,
65c02 this is a $5C NOP instruction which is treated specially by the firmware
for the 65816 this is a WDM instruction.

## \*BLTURBO {B}

        *BLTURBO [M[-]] [L<pagemask>] [R<n>[-]] [T[-]] [?]

        M/M-    Enable/Disable MOS at maximum speed
        L<n>    The hexadecimal number following L forms a bit mask of pages in 
                Low-RAM ($FF0000-$FF7FFF) that are TURBO'd
        R<n>    The ROM in slot n is "throttled" i.e. its instructions are
                executed at 2MHz, regardless of where the ROM is located.
                "X" can be used to throttle ROMs in the opposing map
                "-" reverses i.e. un-throttles the ROM slot.
        T       The CPU is throttled at all times to 2MHz
                "-" reverses i.e. un-throttles the CPU.

### Low RAM Turbo
BLTURBO copies the contents of memory to Chip RAM and causes the CPU to execute
from Chip RAM for these pages. Care should be taken as any writes to the screen 
memory area will be intercepted. This operates much like the Master's \*SHADOW
command except it can be tuned on a page by page basis.

i.e. BLTURBO L03 will cause pages 0 and 1 (zero page and stack) to be executed
from Chip RAM which can give a useful boost to many programs

### Per-rom Throttle

Some ROMs contain timing sensitive code that doesn't work when run at full-speed
these settings allow a 2MHz speed throttle to be placed on such ROM banks.

Typically these settings will be read from CMOS RAM at power-up but may be 
altered temporarily with this command. See [\*CONFIGURE, \*STATUS](#configuration-options) 

### CPU Throttle

This is often useful to bring the whole system to 2MHz running games. This will
also disable the VIA access hacks which should make timing-sensitive games and
demos work as on a normal 6502.

Typically these settings will be read from CMOS RAM at power-up but may be 
altered temporarily with this command. See [\*CONFIGURE, \*STATUS](#configuration-options)


The format of this command's arguments is likely to change in future to allow:
- speed throttling of ROM's/MOS
- speed throttling of shadow memory

Note: It used to be possible to set per-rom and cpu throttle CMOS settings 
with this command, these options are now set using the [\*CONFIGURE, \*STATUS](#configuration-options) command

## \*BLSOUND
        
        \*BLSOUND [ON|OFF|DETUNE]

Enables the Blitter/Paula OSWORD7/BASIC extensions to run. Various operating 
system vectors are trapped and the User VIA's timer 1 is used.

The command must be used *before* any of the \*BLSAMLD, \*BLSAMMAP and 
extended SOUND commands are used.

NOTE: as of July 2020, the DETUNE options does nothing, a BREAK or CTL-BREAK 
will clear the sample table and heap. In future releases this may change.

## \*BLHINF

        *BLHINF [V]

Show HEAP information

V - Verbose, prints a list of allocations on the heap

## \*BLSAMLD

        *BLSAMLD <filename> <SN> [reploffs]

        SN      - sample slot number in hex 0..1F
        reploffs- repeat offset in hex, the sample will repeat continuously 
                  from this point to its end once it has reached its end

Loads a sample (max. size 64k) into a sample slot. First if there is already a
sample in this slot it will be freed from the heap then the file will be checked
for size and a new allocation made on the heap if possible and the sample will 
be loaded.

The sound system expects samples for instruments to be recorded at middle C at 
a sample rate of 8372 which for a middle C note should repeat every 32 samples 
at the fundamental middle C frequency making it easy to specify repeat offsets.

It is often worthwhile for bass instruments to sample at a double sample rate
and add 48 (an octave) to the SOUND pitch to avoid aliasing.

## \*BLSAMMAP

        *BLSAMMAP <CH> <SN>

        CH      Channel number 0..7
        SN      Sample number 0..1F (hex)

Set the default sample number for each channel. If no sample number is specified
in the high byte of the volume SOUND parameter then the default specified here 
will be used.

## \*BLSAMCLR

        *BLSAMCLR [<SN>|*]

Clear a sample (or all samples) and free the memory from the heap.


# OSBYTES

# OSWORDS

The BLTUTIL ROM provides various extension API functions via the OSWORD call.

## OSWORD 7: SOUND

The MOS OSWORD/BASIC SOUND command is extended as follows:

- Channels between &4000 - &5FFF are intercepted by the blitter sound i.e. add 
  &4000 to normal sound command  Channels &4000..7 are allowed: hardware 
  dependent whether 4 or 8 channels are supported where an unsupported channel
  is used it will not play but will be queued as per usual.
- A sample number can be passed in the high byte of Volume so for full volume
  sample #2 pass &02F1 as the volume
- If no sample number is passed (i.e. the top byte of volume is 00 or FF then 
  the sample number as mapped with the \*BLSAMMAP command will be used)
- Sync can be 0..7 instead of 0..3

For a more detailed description of the OSWORD sound interfaces see the document
[SoundQuickstart.md](SoundQuickstart.md)


## OSWORD 99: BLTUTILS

All BLTUTILs control and memory OSWORDs are through a single OSWORD $99 
operation codes for different functions are passed in offset 2 of the control
block:

        A=&99
        +0      Input parameter length
        +1      Output parameter length 
        +2      OP or rom number if < 16

## OSWORD 99, OP &lt; 16 Get ROM/SWRAM ChipRAM base address {B}

This call returns the base address of the given ROM in chip RAM

        Input
                +2      rom #
                +3      flags
        
        Input Flags:
        &80     current set     The currently in-use rom set will be returned, 
                                other wise the map indicate by bit 0
        &40     alternate set   The alternate rom set will be returned use with
                                &80, this will return alternate
        &20     ignore memi     Even if the blitter roms are inhibited this will
                                return the blitter address
        &01     force map 1     Return map 1 regardless of current set
        
        Output
                +2      Return flags
                +3..4   Physical page # of rom base
        
        Return Flags
                &80     Is in flash rom
                &40     Is in a system socket or blitter inhibited or not 
                        present
                &20     Blitter has been inhibited
                &02     Is in current ROM set
                &01     Map 1


If the Blitter is not present or inhibited (and ignore memi flag is not set) 
then the page returned will be &FF80 and the sys flag will be set


## OSWORD 99, OP=&10 Allocate Chip RAM from Heap

Allocate a block of memory from the heap. Blocks are always allocated as a 
whole number of pages.

First any previously freed memory will be searched for the smallest block that 
is large enough to fulfil the request. If no matching block is found then the 
heap will try to extend downwards, if there is not room then the call will fail
and return $FFFF. The current implementation allows a maximum of 64 blocks on 
the heap.

        Input
                +3..4   Number of pages to allocate
        Output
                +3..4   Page number of memory block or $FFFF for fail

The call may fail if there is not enough free space or the Blitter or Paula 
can't be found or a zero length block is requested.


## OSWORD 99, OP=&11 Free a block of memory

A previously allocated block will be freed. The block will be returned either to
the list of free blocks or merged with any neighbouring blocks. If the block is
at the bottom of the heap the heap will close up.

        Input
                +3..4   Page number of the block to free.

--TODO-- move this to a general discussion of the heap
This call will attempt to allocate a block of memory on the heap. The heap is
limited to 64 blocks of memory but can allocate any size block that will fit in
memory between the low heap limit and the top of memory.

By default the heap can grow all the way down to the top of the 

## OSWORD 99, OP=&12 Set HEAPBOT (not yet implemented)

The heap grows downwards from the upper limit (Blitter=1DFFFF, Paul=07FFFF) 
towards HEAPBOT (default 010000). This call can be used to set HEAPBOT, 
if HEAPBOT cannot be moved (i.e. < 01000 or > hardware limit or clashes
with already allocated heap an error will be indicated in the return value)

        Input
                +3..4   new value for HEAPBOT
        Output
                +3      0 for success, -ve for error


## OSWORD 99, OP=&13 Read/Write i2c

This call can be used to do writes, reads or combined write followed by reads 
to or from and attached i2c device.

        + 3     Number of bytes to write
        + 4     Number of bytes to read
        + 5     i2c Device address
        + 6..   Write/read data


The maximum number of bytes that may be read or written is limited to 127

If there is a read following a write and any of the write bytes are not acked by 
the device or any other the read will be skipped.

The number of bytes written and ack'd will be be subtracted from +3 i.e. +3=0 
indicates all written.

The number of bytes read back into the buffer will be subtracted from +4 i.e. 
+4=0 indicates all read

The device address at +5 lowest bit will be set to 1 if the device did not 
acknowledge the address select.

If both the number of bytes to read and write are zero then a device select will
still be performed and the low bit of the device address at +5 updated. This 
can be used as a device probe.

# BLTUTIL ROM internals

The following documentation lays out some internal allocations used by the 
Blitter ROM. This information is subject to change in future revisions of the
ROM.

## i2c CMOS RAM allocations

The mk.2 and mk.3 Blitter boards both contain an i2c EEPROM which may be used 
for storing configuration data the table below outlines the ranges that have 
been pre-allocated to the firmware and ranges which may be used freely for 
end-user applications.

The mk.2 and mk.3 EEPROMs are 64kbit devices with device number A0 the addresses
below are in bytes.

### CMOS ranges
*NB: These allocations have been altered since the Oct 2024, 0.07 release of the
BLTUTIL ROM*

| Address       | Description
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
| 0000-0FFF     | User applications, please update this document with details
| 1000-10FF     | OSBYTE A1/A2 - for the Model B / Electron the BLTUTIL rom provides an OSBYTE A1,A2 MOS replacement
| 1100-11FF     | BLTUTILs firmware (see table below)
| 1200-1FFF     | Reserved please do not use

### MOS Replacement OSBYTE A1,A2

The BLTUTIL ROM provides ersatz versions of OSBYTEs A1, A2, [\*CONFIGURE, \*STATUS](#configuration-options), 
\*STATUS that use this area. The range 1000-107F is accessed in map 0 and the 
range 1080-10FF in map 1.

### BLTUTIL ROM CMOS usage

| Address       | Description
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
| 1100-1101     | Per-rom Throttle setting, 1 bit for each ROM, set #0 (reversed sense i.e. 0 = throttle)
| 1102-1103     | Per-rom Throttle setting, 1 bit for each ROM, set #1 (reversed sense i.e. 0 = throttle)
| 1104-1105     | Default Turbo/Throttle settings for map 0/1


#### 1104/5 Default Turbo / Throttle settings

| Bit   | Descriptions
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------
| 7     | Throttle CPU (for 65xx) to 2MHz
| 6..0  | Future use, default to '1' if unsure


# Configuration Options

The ROM provides some extended \*CONFIGURE and \*STATUS options on all machines
to control Blitter enhancements. These are described in the section 
[Blitter Configuration Options](#blitter-configuration-options). In addition
there are Ersatz versions of some of the Master configuration options that can
be used on the BBC Micro and Electron which are described in the following
section.

## Model B / Electron Configuration

The Mk.2 and 3 Blitter boards contain a CMOS EEPROM which can be used to hold
configuration options to allow these to be accessed the BLTUTIL ROM on Model B
Electron systems provides the following services described below.

There is a set of configuration stored in the CMOS for each of the two ROM maps.
Which applies to the Hard CPU (if it is a 65xx CPU) or the T65 soft-core.

To reset the CMOS for the current map, hold down "R" when powering up.
 
### Reset CMOS

The CMOS for the current RO

### \*CONFIGURE

This command works in a similar way to on the Master series and can be used to
set configuration options.

### Service Calls &28, &29

These are provided to
